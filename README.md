# Chirper Project

This repo is a code-along with the first project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.


## Project Walkthrough

This project i’ve built is called “Chirper”. It’s a Twitter clone that will help  practice:
* Improving the predictability of an application’s state
* Establishing strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store
* Identifying what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.

## Project Description

It a tweeter clone with comments system you can do these things:

* shows tweets sorted from most recently added at the top, to oldest at the bottom :
* each tweet will show:
	** the author
	** the time stamp
	** who the author is replying to
	** the text of the tweet
	** a reply button - with the number of replies (if higher than 0)
	** a like button - with the number of likes (if higher than 0)

* You can reply to a tweet

* You can create a new tweet
